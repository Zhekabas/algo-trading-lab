# GitHub Growth Strategy

## Goals
- Build credible trading/quant profile for airdrop farming
- Show consistent development activity
- Demonstrate technical competence

## Commit Strategy

### Frequency
- 3-5 commits per week (natural pace)
- Cluster around real work sessions
- Avoid obvious patterns (not same time daily)

### What to commit
**Only commit when there's real work:**
- Strategy improvements/fixes
- Backtest results with analysis
- New features or optimizations
- Documentation updates
- Bug fixes
- Parameter optimization findings

**Never commit:**
- Fake changes
- Meaningless tweaks
- Auto-generated spam

## Metrics to Track

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Same commit message repeatedly  
❌ Commits every day at exact same time  
❌ Whitespace-only changes  
❌ "Update README.md" 50 times  
❌ Copying code without attribution
